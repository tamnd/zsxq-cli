```
zsxq <command> [arguments] [flags]
```

Run `zsxq <command> --help` for the full flag list on any command. This
page is the map; keep it in step with the real command tree as you add to it.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `page <ref>` | Fetch a page by path or URL |
| `links <ref>` | List the pages a page links to |
| `serve [--addr]` | Serve the operations over HTTP as NDJSON |
| `mcp` | Run as an MCP server over stdio |
| `version` | Print the version and exit |

`page` and `links` are the example operations the scaffold ships. Add a row here
per operation you declare in `zsxq/domain.go`.

## Global flags

These are shared by every operation, so they work the same on every command.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-o, --output` | Output format: `auto`, `table`, `json`, `jsonl`, `csv`, `tsv`, `url`, `raw` |
| `--fields` | Comma-separated columns to keep |
| `--template` | Go text/template applied per record |
| `--no-header` | Omit the header row in `table` and `csv` |
| `-n, --limit` | Stop after N records (0 means no limit) |
| `--rate` | Minimum delay between requests |
| `--retries` | Retry attempts on rate limit or 5xx |
| `--timeout` | Per-request timeout |
| `--data-dir` | Override the data directory |
| `--no-cache` | Bypass on-disk caches |
| `--db` | Tee every record into a store (e.g. `out.db`, `postgres://...`) |
| `-v, --verbose` | Increase verbosity (repeatable) |
| `-q, --quiet` | Suppress progress output |
| `--color` | `auto`, `always`, or `never` |

See [output formats](/reference/output/) for what `-o`, `--fields`, and
`--template` produce, and [configuration](/reference/configuration/) for
environment variables and defaults.
